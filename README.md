Project 1: Alien Invasion

Page: 233


In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at
the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits
the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.




alien_invasion.py

The main file, alien_invasion.py, creates a number of important objects used
throughout the game: the settings are stored in ai_settings, the main display
surface is stored in screen, and a ship instance is created in this file as
well. Also stored in alien_invasion.py is the main loop of the game, which is
a while loop that calls check_events(), ship.update(), and update_screen().
alien_invasion.py is the only file you need to run when you want to play
Alien Invasion. The other files—settings.py, game_functions.py, ship.py—
contain code that is imported, directly or indirectly, into this file.


settings.py

The settings.py file contains the Settings class. This class only has an
__init__() method, which initializes attributes controlling the game’s
appearance and the ship’s speed.


game_functions.py

The game_functions.py file contains a number of functions that carry out
the bulk of the work in the game. The check_events() function detects relevant
events, such as keypresses and releases, and processes each of these
types of events through the helper functions check_keydown_events() and
check_keyup_events(). For now, these functions manage the movement of
the ship. The game_functions module also contains update_screen(), which
redraws the screen on each pass through the main loop.


ship.py

The ship.py file contains the Ship class. Ship has an __init__() method, an
update() method to manage the ship’s position, and a blitme() method
to draw the ship to the screen. The actual image of the ship is stored in
ship.bmp, which is in the images folder.
